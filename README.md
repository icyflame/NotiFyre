# NotiFyre

It's lit :fire:

Notify when a terminal task is done

![Image could not be displayed](thumbnail_fish.png)

[Sample working video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5iU6cWw36rObk9tNDEwNmhjTzA), sped up at x2.

Install dependencies first :

    sudo apt-get install notify-osd pulseaudio-utils libnotify-bin

**Note:** The above dependencies are generally installed on most systems.

Notifyre has been tested on a fresh install of Ubuntu 16.04 running bash, zsh or
fish. If you have managed to port this script to another shell or another OS,
please open a pull request with the instructions for the same and we will update
the README!

## Bash / ZSH

### Setup

* Place `notifyre.sh` & `bash-preexec.sh` in your home folder

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/kaustubhhiware/NotiFyre.git
    cd NotiFyre
    cp notifyre.sh bash-preexec.sh ~
    ```

* :zap: Lightning fast alternative: Pull only these two files from GitHub!

    ```
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaustubhhiware/NotiFyre/master/notifyre.sh -o ~/notifyre.sh
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rcaloras/bash-preexec/master/bash-preexec.sh -o ~/bash-preexec.sh
    ```

 
 * Add the following lines to the end of `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

    ```sh
    # as close to the end as possible
    source ~/notifyre.sh
    source ~/bash-preexec.sh
    ```

    **Note:** These 2 lines should be added as close to the end of the file as possible.

* If you do not want to be notified for each command, then add this to the end of your rc file:

    ```sh
    source ~/notifyre.sh
    ```

    To get a notification for a command, you need to run it as `nf <command>`

### Configuration

```sh
SOUND=1
SOUND_MIN=10
ALERT=/usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/notifications/Slick.ogg
MIN_INTERVAL=4
```

There are four configurable options in NotiFyre:

1. `SOUND`

    **Options:** 0 or 1

    **Utility:** SOUND=1 will play an alert sound for each notification that
    takes more time than `SOUND_MIN` seconds. This value is a boolean.

2. `SOUND_MIN`

    **Valid values:** 1, 2, 3 ...

    **Utility:** Let's you configure the minimum amount of time a command must
    take for it to trigger a sound notification. (If `SOUND=0`, then no sound
    notification will be played) This value is in seconds.

3. `ALERT`

    **Options:** Path to a sound file 

    **Utility:** The sound file will be played whenever `SOUND=1`
    and a command has taken more time than `SOUND_MIN` seconds

4. `MIN_INTERVAL`


    **Options:** 1, 2, 3, ...

    **Utility:** An option to configure the minimum amount of time that a
    command must take in order to trigger a notification. This value is in
    seconds.

## Fish shell

### Setup

* Place the *prompt_pwd.fish*, _notifyre.fish_ and _nf.fish_ in  your `~/.config/fish/functions/` folder.
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/kaustubhhiware/NotiFyre.git
  cd NotiFyre
  cp prompt_pwd.fish notifyre.fish nf.fish ~/.config/fish/functions/
  ```

* :zap: Lightning fast alternative:

   ```sh
   # Pull the files from Github
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaustubhhiware/NotiFyre/master/prompt_pwd.fish -o ~/.config/fish/functions/prompt_pwd.fish
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaustubhhiware/NotiFyre/master/notifyre.fish -o ~/.config/fish/functions/notifyre.fish
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaustubhhiware/NotiFyre/master/nf.fish -o ~/.config/fish/functions/nf.fish
   ```

* To be notified for each process, add this to your `functions/fish_prompt.fish`
file just before the end :

  ```sh
   function fish_prompt
      ...

      eval (notifyre)  # at the very end
   end
  ```
   This method works pretty well with my **bobthefish** theme and no theme as
   well. Let me know if it doesn't work out for you.


* If you want to be notified only for select commands, you do
not need to modify the `fish_prompt.fish` file.

   Run with `nf command`

   [This might take slightly more time than the process itself to complete
   execution.]

You can learn to write your own functions in fish with
[this](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html) as a starting point.
The working files can be found [in my
dotfiles](https://github.com/kaustubhhiware/dotfiles/tree/master/fish).

### Configuration

```sh
set -x timeout 1
set -x ring_timeout 2
set -x ALERT /usr/share/sounds/ubuntu/notifications/Slick.ogg
```
There are three available options:

1. `timeout` : Same as option `MIN_INTERVAL` in the Bash / ZSH section above
2. `ring_timeout` : Same as option `SOUND_MIN` in the Bash / ZSH section above
3. `ALERT` : Same as option `ALERT` in the Bash / ZSH Section above

Note: The notifications appear in a queue, and cannot be implemented parallely
(known bug in notify-send)

# Why?

I had to reinstall Ubuntu quite a number of times thanks to how awesome Windows messed up my laptop. This script seeks to help anyone who multi-tasks, or does not constantly check their terminals. [ntfy](https://github.com/dschep/ntfy) wasn't consistent always, so made this.

Tested on fresh install of Ubuntu 16.04, and on Arch Linux. Ubuntu 14 may require [Slick.ogg](Slick.ogg) whose path must be changed before usage.

## Not working/ Message not displayed
check if notify-osd is working with this - `notify-send "hi"`

If no message pops up, it means notify-osd has stopped working. Reinstall some dependencies and try again:

    sudo apt-get --reinstall install libnotify-bin notify-osd
